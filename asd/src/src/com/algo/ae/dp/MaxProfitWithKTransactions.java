/**
 * Max profit with K transactions
 *
 * You are given an array of positive integers representing the prices of
 * a single stock on various days (each index in the array represents a
 * different day). You are also given an integer k, which represents the
 * number of transactions you are allowed to make. One transaction consists
 * of buying the stock on a given day and selling it on another later day.
 *
 * Write a function that returns the maximum profit that you can make by
 * buying and selling the stock, given k transactions.
 *
 * Note that you can only hold one share of stock at a time; in other words,
 * you can't buy more than one share of the stock on any given day, and you
 * can't buy a share of stock if you are still holding another share. Also,
 * you don't need to use all k transactions that you are allowed.
 *
 * Sample input:
 *
 * prices = [5, 11, 3, 50, 60, 90]
 * k = 2
 *
 * Sample output: 93 // Buy: 5, Sell: 11; Buy: 3, Sell: 90
