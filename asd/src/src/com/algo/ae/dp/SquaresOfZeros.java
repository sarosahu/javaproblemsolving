/**
 * Square of Zeros
 *
 * Write a function that takes in a squre-shaped nxn 2-dimensional array of
 * only 1s and 0s and returns a boolean representing whether the input matrix
 * contains a square whose borders are made of only 0s.
 *
 * Note that 1x1 squre doesn't count as a valid squre for the purpose of this
 * question. In other words, a singular 0 in the input matrix doesn't constitute
 * a square whose borders are made up only 0s; a square of zeros has to be at
 * least 2x2.
 *
 * Sample input:
 * matrix = [
 *  [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
 *  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
 *  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
 *  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
 *  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
 *  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
 * ]
 *
 * Sample output: true
